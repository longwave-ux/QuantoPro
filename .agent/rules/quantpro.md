Always understand the full logic
do tests before and after, to see if everything works as expected and no new errors are inserted
If a variable or a field need to be modified, understand the chain of the variable of field before editing, in order to make all the chain coherent
After every modification, do tests to verify the result is as expected, and no other things are broken
Use browser extension if needed to confirm everything is working
